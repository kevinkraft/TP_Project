Classical Shell Theorem
-----------------------
-----------------------

* Shell Theorem: (wiki)
      1. A spherically symmetric body affects other bodies gravitationally as if all of its mass were concentrated at its centre
      2. If the spherically symmetric body is hollow no net gravitational force is felt by an object inside the hollow body, regardless of the position of the object inside the body
* Proved by Issac Newton (wiki)
* Proved with Calculus or "Gauss's law for gravity" (wiki)
* Corollary:
  * inside a solid sphere the gravitational force varies linearly with distance from the centre (wiki)
* Easily generalized to any inverse square law, i.e. electromag

Shell Theorem in General Relativity
-----------------------------------
-----------------------------------

* Its called Birkhoff's Theorem
  * Any spherically symmetric solution to the vaccuum field equations must be static and asymptotically flat
  * Consequences:
    * exterior solution must be Schwarzchild metric
    * interior solution must be Minkowskian metric, i.e. net gravitational force vanishes, Minkowskian describes special relativity where there is no gravity


 
Proof

Interesting Calculations
------------------------
------------------------

* Do the calculation for different configurations, annuli etc.
* See what the gravitational force is on the inside edge of a spherical shell with a certain thickness.
