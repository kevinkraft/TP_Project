Lorentz Group
---------------
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group
* ERROR. Mobius Group
  * Because the restricted Lorentz group SO+(1, 3) is isomorphic to the Möbius group PSL(2,C), its conjugacy classes(types) also fall into five
    classes:
    1. Elliptic
    2. Hyperbolis
    3. loxodromic
    4. Parabolic
       * These are the ones we have considered
       * Often called null rotations, as they preserve null vectors
       * lead to gauge symmetries of massless particles with helicity |h| >= 1
    5. Identity
  * Action of the spin group on spinors

    * ERROR. LOOK FOR IN LIBRARY
  * Fractional Linear transformation also known as "Mobius Transformation"
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation
    * Also called "projective Linear Group"
  * A maximal compact subgroup of the mobius group is isomorphic to SO(3) of rotations in 3D
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_quantum_mechanics#Lorentz_group_in_relativistic_quantum_mechanics
* Quantum Mechanical Symmetries
  * Lorentz group is 6D
  * Spin representations of the Lorentz group
  * In quantum electrodynamics, the symmetry group is U(1) and is abelian. In quantum chromodynamics, the symmetry group is SU(3) and is
    non-abelian.

  * Mass invariant under Mobius Transformation??

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group
  * Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation#Special_relativity
  * Any Lorentz transform can be written as a proper orthochronous, together with one or both of the two discrete transformations; space
    inversion P and time reversal T
* http://staff.science.uva.nl/~msnoek/GT/LectNotes_GrTh_2011_2.pdf
    * Just like SU(2) was the universal covering group of SO(3), SL(2, C) is the covering group of L↑+ (proper, orthochronous).
