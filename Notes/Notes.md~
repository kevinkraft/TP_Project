Classical Shell Theorem
-----------------------

* Shell Theorem:
      1. A spherically symmetric body affects other bodies gravitationally as if all of its mass were concentrated at its centre
      2. If the spherically symmetric body is hollow no net gravitational force is felt by an object inside the hollow body, regardless of the position of the object inside the body
