\section{The Fractional Linear Transformation}\label{Fractional_Section_Extended_Complex}

In this section a fractional linear transformation is derived from extending the stereographic projection between a $2$-sphere and the complex plane to Minkowskian space-time. The fixed points of this transformation are determined and found to be directly related to the null directions of a Lorentz transformation. Some examples of fractional linear transformations and their associated null directions are then given. 

\subsection{Stereographic Projection and the Extended Complex Plane}\label{Section_Stereographic_Extended_Complex}

First, a one to one mapping between the $2$-sphere, $\mathbb{S}^2$ and the extended complex plane $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is constructed \cite[p. 10]{Spinors_I_Penrose}. \textit{Stereographic projection} is the mapping of points on a sphere to points on a plane. In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with rectangular Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, consider the unit sphere with centre $(0,0,0)$, defined by

\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{S}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3 \text{ : } x^2 + y^2 + x^2 = 1.
\end{equation*}

\noindent The projection $P \rightarrow Q$ is a stereographic projection, see Fig.(\ref{Stereographic_Projecttion_Fig}). A relationship between $(X,Y,0)$ and $(x,y,z)$ is constructed as follows. $P$ is subdivided into the line segment $NQ$ in some ratio, $l:m$ say. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\caption{\textit{The projection from the unit $2$-sphere to the $x$,$y$-plane is called a Stereographic projection. The point $P$ on the shpere is mapped to the point $Q$ on the plane by translation along the line joining the points $N$ and $P$}}
\label{Stereographic_Projecttion_Fig}
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{figs/4_1.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent By coordinate geometry

\begin{eqnarray*}  
x = \frac{lX + mO}{l+m} = \frac{lX}{l+m}, \\
y = \frac{lY + mO}{l+m} = \frac{lY}{l+m}, \\
z = \frac{l.0+ m.1}{l+m} = \frac{m}{l+m}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent Where O is the position of the origin. This implies that

\begin{eqnarray*}
1-z = \frac{l}{l+m}, \\
x = (1-z)X, \\
y = (1-z)Y.
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent It is also known that $x^2+ y^2 +z^2 = 1$, so using this relation it is clear that

\begin{eqnarray*}
x^2 + y^2 = 1-z^2 = (1-z) (1+z), \\
(1-z)^2(X^2 +Y^2) = (1-z) (1+z).
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent If the point $N$ is excluded, i.e. $z \neq 1$ then divide by $(1-z)^2$ to obtain

\begin{equation*} 
X^2 + Y^2 = \frac{1+z}{1-z},
\end{equation*}

\noindent and rearrange to find

\begin{equation}\label{Ext_Complex_z_in_term_XY} 
z = \frac{X^2 + y^2 - 1}{X^2 + y^2 + 1}.
\end{equation}

Define $\zeta = X+ iY$ and rewrite Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_z_in_term_XY}) to see that

\begin{equation*}
z = \frac{\zeta\bar{\zeta} - 1}{\zeta\bar{\zeta} + 1},
\end{equation*}

\noindent Which implies

\begin{equation*}
1- z = \frac{2}{\zeta\bar{\zeta} + 1}.
\end{equation*}

\noindent So relations for $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{S}^2 \backslash \{N\}$ have been obtained in terms of $\zeta$, such that

\begin{align}\label{Ext_Complex_xy_interms_zeta}
x + iy & = \zeta (1-z) = \frac{2\zeta}{\zeta\bar{\zeta} + 1}, \\\label{Ext_Complex_z_interms_zeta}
z  & = \frac{\zeta\bar{\zeta} - 1}{\zeta\bar{\zeta} + 1}.
\end{align}

\noindent Hence the points on $\mathbb{S}^2 \backslash \{N\}$ are labelled by complex numbers $\zeta \in \mathbb{C}$. If a point $\zeta = \infty$, called the point at infinity of $\mathbb{C}$, is allowed then the following limits hold

\begin{eqnarray*}
x+ iy = \frac{2/\bar{\zeta}}{1 + 1/\zeta\bar{\zeta}} \rightarrow 0 \text{, as  } \zeta \rightarrow \infty, \\
z = \frac{1- 1/\zeta\bar{\zeta}}{1+ 1/\zeta\bar{\zeta}} \rightarrow 1 \text{, as  } \zeta \rightarrow \infty. 
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent Then $N = (0,0,1)$ corresponds to $\zeta = \infty$. Thus in this way there is a one to one correspondence between the points of $\mathbb{S}^2$ and the points of the \textit{extended complex plane} $\hat{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C} \cup {\infty}$, which is the usual complex plane with the point at infinity added. Since $\mathbb{S}^2$ has finite surface area, and is therefore called a \textit{compact manifold}, the identification of the points of $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ with the points of $\mathbb{S}^2$ is called the \textit{compactification} of $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$.

The pair $(\zeta, \bar{\zeta})$ are called the \textit{stereographic coordinates} on $\mathbb{S}^2 \backslash \{N\}$. How are they related to the polar angles $\theta$ and $\phi$? To investigate this write the usual spherical polar coordinates in terms of $\zeta$. First it is known that

\begin{align*}
x & = \sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}, \\
y & = \sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}, \\
z & = \cos{\theta}.
\end{align*}

\noindent So by Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_z_interms_zeta}) it is clear that

\begin{gather*}
z = \cos{\theta} = \frac{\zeta\bar{\zeta} - 1}{\zeta\bar{\zeta} + 1} \\
\zeta\bar{\zeta}\cos{\theta} + \cos{\theta} = \zeta\bar{\zeta} - 1\\
\zeta\bar{\zeta} = \frac{1 + \cos{\theta}}{1 - \cos{\theta}} = \frac{2\cos^2{\left(\theta/2\right)}}{2\sin^2{\left(\theta/2\right)}} \\
\zeta\bar{\zeta} = \cot^2{\left(\theta/2\right)}.
\end{gather*}

\noindent Now use Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_xy_interms_zeta}) to obtain

\begin{gather*}
\sin{\theta}(\cos{\phi} +i \sin{\phi}) = \frac{2\zeta}{\cot^2{\left(\theta/2\right)} + 1 }, \\
2\sin{\left(\theta/2\right)}\cos{\left(\theta/2\right)}e^{i\phi} = 2\zeta \sin^2{\left(\theta/2\right)}, \\
\zeta = e^{i\phi}\cot{\left(\theta/2\right)}. 
\end{gather*}

\noindent This makes sense as if $\zeta = \infty$ then $\theta = 0$ as one would expect. The coordinates $(\theta, \phi)$ can be used if one wishes to avoid working with $\zeta = \infty$. In summary the following coordinate transformations have been constructed

\begin{align}
\vec{n} = (x, y, z) & = (\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}, \sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}, \cos{\theta}), \\ \label{Ext_Complex_Vec_n}
&
\begin{Huge}
                     = \left( \frac{\bar{\zeta} + \zeta}{\bar{\zeta}\zeta + 1}  ,i\frac{\bar{\zeta} - \zeta}{\bar{\zeta}\zeta + 1}, \frac{\bar{\zeta}\zeta - 1}{\bar{\zeta}\zeta + 1}  \right),
\end{Huge}
\end{align}

\noindent where here $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\vec{n} \cdot \vec{n} = 1$.

\subsection{Extension to Minkowskian Sapce-Time}\label{Fractional_Section_Extension_to_Minkowskian}

These results are now extended to Minkowskian space-time to derive an expression for the fractional Linear transformation. Let $\vec{x} = (x,y,z,t)$ be a point on the future null cone with origin $(0,0,0,0)$. Denote the future null cone as $N^{+}$, so that 

\begin{equation*}
N^+ : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - t^2 = 0 \text{,  for  } t>0,
\end{equation*}

\noindent as all the vectors in the null cone have a Lorentz quadratic form equal to zero by definition. The intersection with the space-like hypersurface $t = \text{const}>0$ is a 2-sphere denoted by 

\begin{equation}\label{Ext_Complex_2Sphere_Definition}
\mathbb{S}^2 (t) : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = t^2 = \text{const}, 
\end{equation}

\noindent see Fig.(\ref{Ext_Complex_Intersection_Cone_Plane_Fig}). There is a generator of $N^+$ passing through each point of $\mathbb{S}^2 (t)$, they are the null geodesics tangent to $N^+$ and passing through the point $(0,0,0,0)$. Hence the points of $\mathbb{S}^2 (t)$, denoted by $(\theta,\phi)$ or $\zeta$, label the \textit{generators} of $N^{+}$. Consider the hypersufaces $t= \pm 1$ and the unit spheres generated by the intersection of these hypersurfaces with the past and future light cones. Points on the surface of these spheres correspond to generators. Each generator has two degrees of freedom, thus with three null vectors we have six degrees of freedom, the same as the Lorentz transformation. In this way a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation can be generated by moving these three points along the surface of the $t = 1$ sphere. This is interesting as any arbitrary displacement of the three points along the surface of the sphere will generate a Lorentz Transformation \cite[p. 100]{Relativity_Synge}. It is also interesting to note that the $t = -1$ sphere can be thought of as the field of vision of an observer at $t = 0$. What an observer at the origin would see is exactly what one would see from the centre of the $t = -1$ sphere \cite[p. 9]{Spinors_I_Penrose}.   
 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\caption{\textit{Future null cone of Minkowskian space-time. Shown in red is the intersection between the future null cone and the hyperplane $t=\text{const}$. This surface is the sphere in three dimensions from which a stereographic projection was derived earlier. A proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation is guaranteed if three points on the surface of the $t = 1$ sphere, which are exactly null vectors in Minkowskian space-time, are moved arbitrarily along the surface}}
\label{Ext_Complex_Intersection_Cone_Plane_Fig}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figs/4_5_2.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For every generator and any $t>0$ it is clear that

\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{x}{t}\right)^2 +\left(\frac{y}{t}\right)^2 +\left(\frac{z}{t}\right)^2 = 1.
\end{equation*}

\noindent This is just the definition of a $2$-sphere, as in Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_2Sphere_Definition}), normalised with respect to a constant $t$. Hence we can write $\vec{x}$ in terms of the coordinate transformation of (\ref{Ext_Complex_Vec_n})

\begin{align}\nonumber
\vec{x} & = t(\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}, \sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}, \cos{\theta}, 1), \\\label{Ext_Complex_vec_x_relations}
        & = t
\begin{Huge}
\left( \frac{\bar{\zeta} + \zeta}{\bar{\zeta}\zeta + 1}  ,i\frac{\bar{\zeta} - \zeta}{\bar{\zeta}\zeta + 1}, \frac{\bar{\zeta}\zeta - 1}{\bar{\zeta}\zeta + 1},1  \right).
\end{Huge}
\end{align}

\noindent Where a $4^{\text{th}}$ component is included as $\vec{x}$ is an element of Minkowskian space-time. Thus the direction of $\vec{x}$ is determined explicitly by $(\theta,\phi)$ or $\zeta$ as $\vec{x}$ has the same form as the unit vector of Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_Vec_n}). Note that all possible directions of $\vec{x}$ on $N^{+}$ are covered if $\zeta \in \hat{\mathbb{C}}$. Now the Lorentz transformation $\vec{x} \rightarrow \vec{x}'$ is investigated, it takes the form  

\begin{equation*}
\vec{x} \rightarrow \vec{x}' = t'\left( \frac{\bar{\zeta'} + \zeta'}{\bar{\zeta'}\zeta' + 1}  ,i\frac{\bar{\zeta'} - \zeta'}{\bar{\zeta'}\zeta' + 1}, \frac{\bar{\zeta'}\zeta' - 1}{\bar{\zeta'}\zeta' + 1},1  \right).
\end{equation*}

\noindent The null direction $\zeta$ is transformed to the null direction $\zeta'$, where the relation between them must be determined. Construct the matrix $A(\vec{x})$ as in Eqn.(\ref{Special_Matrices_A_first}),

\begin{equation*}
A(\vec{x}) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{2t}{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1} & & \frac{2t\zeta}{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1} \\
 & & \\
\frac{2t\bar{\zeta}}{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1} & & \frac{2t\zeta\bar{\zeta}}{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1} \\
\end{array}
\right)
=
c_0\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1           & \zeta \\ 
\bar{\zeta} & \bar{\zeta}\zeta \\ 
\end{array}
\right),
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $c_0 = 2t/(\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. Note that as $\vec{x}$ is a null vector $\det{(A(\vec{x}))} = 0$. Thus the transformed matrix $A(\vec{x}')$ is given similarly as

\begin{equation*}
A(\vec{x}') = 
{c_0}'\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1           & \zeta' \\ 
\bar{\zeta'} & \bar{\zeta'}\zeta' \\ 
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation*}

\noindent Now, as in the examples in section (\ref{Special_Linear_Matrices_of_Lorentz}) we determine the special linear matrix $U$ such that

\begin{equation}\label{Ext_Complex_UAU}
A(\vec{x}') = U A(\vec{x}) U^{\dagger}
\end{equation}

\noindent As before, this matrix equation is written component wise as

\begin{equation*}
{c_0}'\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1           & \zeta' \\ 
\bar{\zeta'} & \bar{\zeta'}\zeta' \\ 
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha & \beta \\
\gamma & \delta \\
\end{array}
\right)
{c_0}\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1           & \zeta \\ 
\bar{\zeta} & \bar{\zeta}\zeta \\ 
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\bar{\alpha} & \bar{\beta} \\
\bar{\gamma} & \bar{\delta} \\
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation*}

\noindent Then three separate relations between $\zeta$ and $\zeta'$ are obtained

\begin{align}\label{Ext_Complex_zeta_trans_1} 
{c_0}' & = c_0 (\alpha \bar{\alpha} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \zeta + \bar{\alpha} \beta \bar{\zeta} + \beta \bar{\beta} \zeta \bar{\zeta}), \\\label{Ext_Complex_zeta_trans_2} 
{c_0}'\zeta' & = c_0 (\alpha \bar{\gamma} + \alpha \bar{\delta} \zeta + \bar{\gamma} \beta \bar{\zeta} + \beta \bar{\delta} \zeta \bar{\zeta}), \\\label{Ext_Complex_zeta_trans_3} 
{c_0}'\zeta'\bar{\zeta'} & = c_0 (\gamma \bar{\gamma} + \gamma \bar{\delta} \zeta + \bar{\gamma} \delta \bar{\zeta} + \delta \bar{\delta} \zeta \bar{\zeta}). 
\end{align} 

\noindent Using Eqns.(\ref{Ext_Complex_zeta_trans_1}) and (\ref{Ext_Complex_zeta_trans_2}) and factorising to obtain

\begin{equation*}
\zeta' = \frac{{c_0}'\zeta'}{{c_0}'} = \frac{\alpha(\bar{\gamma} + \bar{\delta}\zeta) + \beta \bar{\zeta}(\bar{\gamma} + \bar{\delta}\zeta)}{\alpha(\bar{\alpha} + \bar{\beta}\zeta) + \beta \bar{\zeta}(\bar{\alpha} + \bar{\beta}\zeta)} \\
\end{equation*}

\noindent Thus 

\begin{equation}\label{Extended_Complex_Fractional_Linear_Transformation}
\zeta' = \frac{(\bar{\gamma} + \bar{\delta}\zeta)}{(\bar{\alpha} + \bar{\beta}\zeta)},
\end{equation}

\noindent with $\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma = 1$ as before. This is a \textit{fractional linear transformation} of the extended complex plane $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$. There is a one to one correspondence here between proper, orthochronous Lorentz transformations and fractional linear transformations of the extended complex plane \cite[p. 9-10]{Hypersurfaces_Hogan_Barrabes}(ERROR good ref)\cite[p. 102]{Relativity_Synge}(ERROR. terrible). This is because the matrices $\pm U$ both satisfy Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_UAU}) as in the previous section, but now both matrices give the same transformation as the signs will cancel in the fractional transformation.

\subsection{Fixed points and Their Associated Null Directions}

A given Lorentz transformation is equivalent to known $\alpha$, $\beta$ , $\gamma$ and $\delta$ parameters module a sign and therefore gives an explicit fractional linear transformation. For a given Lorentz transformation a \textit{fixed point} of the corresponding fractional linear transformation corresponds to an invariant null direction. The fixed points $\zeta$ satisfy the relation $\zeta' = \zeta$. Thus from Eq.(\ref{Extended_Complex_Fractional_Linear_Transformation})

\begin{gather}\nonumber
\zeta' = \frac{(\bar{\gamma} + \bar{\delta}\zeta)}{(\bar{\alpha} + \bar{\beta}\zeta)} = \zeta, \\\label{Ext_Complex_fixed_point}
\bar{\beta}\zeta^2 + (\bar{\alpha}- \bar{\delta})\zeta - \bar{\gamma} = 0. 
\end{gather}

\noindent Clearly this is a quadratic equation over the field $\mathbb{C}$, thus it has two roots in general. The non-singular case is when these roots do not coincide, hence a Lorentz transformation does indeed leave two null directions invariant in general.  If Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_fixed_point}) has only one root then the corresponding Lorentz transformation leaves one null direction invariant, this is the singular case.

Consider Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_fixed_point}) again. Divide by $\zeta^2$ to obtain

\begin{equation*}
\bar{\beta} + (\bar{\alpha}- \bar{\delta})\zeta^{-1} - \bar{\gamma}\zeta^{-2} = 0.
\end{equation*}

\noindent Hence $\zeta = \infty$ is a solution of this equation if $\beta = 0$. If $\zeta = \infty$ then $\vec{x}$ is given by $\vec{x} = t(0,0,1,1)$ by Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_vec_x_relations}). Thus it is clear that this corresponds to the null direction $z=t$. Compare this to Example 3, Section (\ref{Special_Linear_Matrices_Example_3}). Here $\beta$ is zero AND the null direction is $z=t$ as expected. If $\zeta = 0$ is a solution to Eqn.(\ref{Ext_Complex_fixed_point}) it is required that $\gamma = 0$, thus $\vec{x} = (0,0,-1,1)$. So it is predicted that a Lorentz transformation with a special linear matrix of the form

\begin{equation*}   
U = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha & \beta \\
0 & \delta \\
\end{array}
\right),
\end{equation*}   

\noindent will leave the $z=-t$ null direction invariant. The example in section (\ref{Ext_Complex_Ex_end}) illustrates a case where the null direction is found to be $x=\pm t$, due to the form of the matrix $U$. The choice of the components of the matrix $A$ in Eqn.(\ref{Special_Matrices_A_first}) determine which direction is the null direction. The initial choice of $A$ gives special significance to the $z$ component, this of course is arbitrary. In Appendix (\ref{Appendix_Special_Significance_x}), the example in Section (\ref{Special_Linear_Matrices_Example_3}) is repeated for the case when special significance is given to $x$. 

\subsection{Example: Standard Lorentz Transformation}\label{Ext_Complex_Ex_end}

Continuing on from Example 2, section (\ref{Special_Linear_Matrices_Example_2}), where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$ were determined. $\zeta'$ can now be expressed as a fractional linear transformation by Eqn.(\ref{Extended_Complex_Fractional_Linear_Transformation})

\begin{equation*} 
\zeta' = \frac{-\sqrt{\gamma_0 - 1} + \sqrt{\gamma_0 + 1}\zeta}{\sqrt{\gamma_0 + 1} - \sqrt{\gamma_0 - 1}\zeta}.
\end{equation*}

\noindent If the condition $\zeta' = \zeta$ is imposed then

\begin{gather*}
\sqrt{\gamma_0 - 1}(\zeta^2 - 1) = 0, \\
\zeta = \pm 1.
\end{gather*}

In the $\zeta = +1$ case, $\vec{x} = t(1,0,0,1)$ and the invariant direction is $x=t$. Similarly in the $\zeta = -1$ case $\vec{x} = t(-1,0,0,1)$ and the invariant direction is $x = - t$.
