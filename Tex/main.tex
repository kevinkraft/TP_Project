\title{Singular Lorentz Transformations and Pure Radiation Fields}

\date{\today}

\begin{abstract}
\textit{This report deals with those proper orthochronous Lorentz transformations (POLTs) that have only one fixed null direction, known as singular Lorentz transformations. It will be shown that in general, Lorentz transformations have two fixed null directions, the special case where these coincide is considered. Starting with the Schwarzschild solution of the vacuum field equations, a novel form of Minkowskian space-time will be derived. It will be shown that a seemingly trivial transformation of this strange Minkowskian space-time is a singular Lorentz transformation, which with further inspection will imply that all singular Lorentz transformations are $2$-parameter abelian subgroups of the Lorentz group. A connection between $2 \times 2$ Hermitian matrices and Minkowskian space-time will be established which gives a two to one correspondence between $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ matrices and POLTs, with numerous examples. Then a coordinate transformation between Minkowskian space-time and the extended complex plane will be constructed through stereographic projection. It will be shown that a POLT in these coordinates gives the so called fractional linear, or Mobius transformation and thus there is a one to one correspondence between POLTs and fractional linear transformations. Certain conditions will then be applied to this transformation to select only those which give singular Lorentz transformations. These results will then be applied to infinitesimal Lorentz transformations to find that they have the same form as the Lorentz force. By considering the singular infinitesimal Lorentz transformations it will be shown that if the world line of a charged particle is generated by such a transformation then the particle is moving in a pure radiation electromagnetic field. The form of the pure radiation conditions will be written in terms of Minkowskian space-time coordinates to find that the null direction in Minkowskian space-time is the propagation direction of the radiation and that the electric and magnetic fields and the propagation direction in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form an orthonormal triad. The importance of the Lorentz transformation in physics is most evident in special relativity and particle physics. As will be discussed here the irreducible pieces of the Lorentz group are representations of physical particles and thus are essential for any understanding of the properties of particles and how they interact with each other.}
